## Introduction

This project is part of the EU H2020 [SynchroniCity](https://synchronicity-iot.eu) project and it is based on the [PEP Proxy - Wilma](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/pep-proxy-wilma) FIWARE GE.

- You will find the source code of this project in GitHub [here](https://github.com/caposseleDigicat/fiware-pep-proxy)

Thanks to this component and together with Identity Management and, optionally, with Authorization PDP GEs, you will add authentication and authorization security to your backend applications. Thus, only FIWARE users will be able to access your GEs or REST services. But you will be able also to manage specific permissions and policies to your resources allowing different access levels to your users.

## How to Build & Install

<a name="def-docker"></a>
### Docker

We provide a Docker image to facilitate you the building of this GE.

- [Here](https://github.com/caposseleDigicat/fiware-pep-proxy/tree/master/extras/docker) you will find the Dockerfile and the documentation explaining how to use it.
- In [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/angelocapossele/pep-proxy-accounting/) you will find the public image.

For deploying the SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace the first step is creating a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents (or use the one provided in this GitHub repo):

```
version: '3'
services:
    mongo:
        image: mongo:3.2
        restart: always
        ports:
            - 27117:27017
        networks:
            main:
        volumes:
            - ./mongo-data:/data/db
    pep:
        image: angelocapossele/pep-proxy-accounting:latest
        restart: always
        links:
            - mongo
        volumes:
            - ./config.js:/opt/fiware-pep-proxy/config.js
        ports:
            - 7000:7000
        networks:
            main:
                aliases:
                    - pep.docker

networks:
    main:
        external: true
```

The next step is providing the configuration file required by the different components using the configured volume.
It is possible to find a configuration template file (as well as the `docker-compose.yml`) in this GitHub repo (https://github.com/caposseleDigicat/fiware-pep-proxy/tree/master/extras/docker)

In particular, the following parameters have to be configured:

`PEP Proxy - Wilma Plus` supports both the old Keyrock version (prior to Keyrock 7) and the new version (from Keyrock 7). The version of your IdM has to be provided in the `config.js` without specifing the subversion (e.g., `keyrock:5` or `keyrock:7`):

```
config.idm = {
    version: 'keyrock:5',
	host: 'account.lab.fiware.org',
	port: 443,
	ssl: true
}
```

The application to be secured (e.g., `Orion Context Broker`) has to be provided as follows: 

```
config.app_host = '';
config.app_port = '';
// Use true if the app server listens in https
config.app_ssl = false;
```

`PEP` needs to be configured with the parameters obtained while registering it to the IdM. In this section, `app_id` refers to the `client_id` of the application to be secured.

```
// Credentials obtained when registering PEP Proxy in app_id in Account Portal
config.pep = {
	app_id: '',
	username: '',
	password: '',
	trusted_apps : []
}
```

To enable the RBAC feature, set this parameter to `true`, otherwise `PEP` will act as the traditional `Fiware PEP Proxy - Wilma GE`

```
// if enabled PEP checks permissions of NGSIv2 request with a Role Based Access Control
config.rbac = true;
```

`PEP Proxy - Wilma Plus` is able to log each request/response for admin purposes. It store these info in a `MongoDB` instance.
To enable the logging feature, set this parameter to `true`, otherwise `PEP` will act as the traditional `Fiware PEP Proxy - Wilma GE`. 

```
//if enabled PEP logs access requests and responses on mongoDb
config.logging = true;
```

## API Overview

Requests to proxy should be made with a special HTTP Header: X-Auth-Token. 
This header contains the OAuth access token obtained from FIWARE IDM GE.

Example of request:

<pre>
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: proxy_host
X-Auth-Token:z2zXk...ANOXvZrmvxvSg
</pre>

To test the proxy you can generate this request running the following command:

<pre>
curl --header "X-Auth-Token:z2zXk...ANOXvZrmvxvSg" http://proxy_host
</pre>

Once authenticated, the forwarded request will include additional HTTP headers with user info:

<pre>
X-Nick-Name: nickname of the user in IdM
X-Display-Name: display name of user in IdM
X-Roles: roles of the user in IdM
X-Organizations: organizations in IdM
</pre>

## Policies

When enabling the RBAC feature, PEP checks permissions of NGSIv2 requests with a Role Based Access Control. Roles are structured as a set of attributes and have to
be provided according to the following scheme:

```
fiware-service|operation|entityType|entityID|attribute
```

The following list provides some examples:

* `|GET|AirQualityObserved||`: will grant `GET` permission for each entity of type `AirQualityObserved`
* `tenantRZ1|GET|AirQualityObserved||`: will grant `GET` permission for each entity of type `AirQualityObserved` under the Fiware-Service `tenantRZ1`
* `tenantRZ1|GET|AirQualityObserved|sensor_1|`: will grant `GET` permission for `sensor_1` entity of type `AirQualityObserved` under the Fiware-Service `tenantRZ1`
* `tenantRZ1|GET|AirQualityObserved|sensor_1|temperature`: will grant `GET` permission for the attribute `temperature` of `sensor_1` entity of type `AirQualityObserved` under the Fiware-Service `tenantRZ1`

Please note that this feature leverage on the `role name` field provided by the Keyrock IdM. By default, this field has a size of 64B, thus, if planning to set complex policies this size has to be changed.
To change the size of the field `role name`, please modify this line in the `Keyrock` code:

* `Keyrock version prior to 7`: in the file `./keystone/contrib/roles/backends/sql.py` change the line `name = sql.Column(sql.String(64), nullable=False)` to `name = sql.Column(sql.String(256), nullable=False)`. Once, modified, restart the Keyrock instance.  
* `Keyrock version 7`:  in the file `/opt/fiware-idm/models/role.js` change the line `type: DataTypes.STRING(64) + ' CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode__ci',` to `type: DataTypes.STRING(256) + ' CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode__ci',`. After this, you will also need to run the following command on the IdM `MySQL` instance: `ALTER TABLE role ALTER COLUMN name VARCHAR (500) NOT NULL; `
